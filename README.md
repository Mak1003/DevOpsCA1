# ðŸ“° Fake or Real: The Impostor Hunt

This repository contains my solution and contributions to the Kaggle competition [Fake or Real: The Impostor Hunt](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/fake-or-real-the-impostor-hunt).  
The challenge is to build a model that can **detect if two news articles are written by the same author (real) or by an impostor (fake).**

## ðŸ“Œ Competition Overview

- **Task**: Given pairs of news articles, determine whether they were written by the **same author** (REAL) or **different authors** (FAKE).
- **Input**:
  - Training data (`train.csv`) containing article pairs with labels.
  - Test data (`/test/article_xxxx/file_1.txt`, `/file_2.txt`).
- **Output**: A submission `.csv` with predictions (`id`, `label`).
